I'm Marcos Ginel, welcome to my github web page!

### More Information

I've been backend developer (Java, Struts, Spring, NodeJS, Django), with experience in Hadoop and Spark (Big Data). After this, I went directly as "frontend lead" with AngularJS, Angular, ReactJS and now I'm playing with VueJS. I did some Ionic and Android development (Cordova included!) and ended up doing DevOps practices as AWS Cloud Architect. Lot of Jenkins, Docker and a little bit of Kubernetes.

So basically I'm the guy who loves to roll up his sleeves.
